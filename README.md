# NaughtyShop

#This is a shop like a ecoomerce it's not a real shop 

#this is only a project shop only how to use react and node.js 

#if you want to use this project it's very easy and it's project is big one also but i have coded very understanding files 

#when you can open it you will get many files or many folders but it's easy to understrand bacause i have maded single folder to single files

#it's easy to understrand and easy to use it

#so how can you run that project 

#you just go to terminal and go to cd/backend or run command nodemon server.js
#then you just go to cd/fronted and run command npm start

#now project will be started so you can use that 

#still i have not full project now but i will do more work after some times so that why i have stoped to work now 

#when i start to work then i update read me file and update all files also on my github project
